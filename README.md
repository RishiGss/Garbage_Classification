# Garbage_Classification
Garbage classification using Keras and Pytorch frameworks. Multilabel image classification.

[Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/4983/waste-generation-worldwide/ "Global Waste Generation - Statistics & Facts") and the [World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html#:~:text=The%20world%20generates%202.01%20billion,from%200.11%20to%204.54%20kilograms. "Trends in Solid Waste Management") have stated that nearly 2.01 billion tonnnes of municipal solid waste are generated every year. It might increase by 7-% to 3.5 billion tonnes bby 2050. 3R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) priniciple helps a lot in overcoming this issue. Waste segregation is the first task to be done before recycling wastes. 

This repository implements a method to segregate waste by image classification using Neural Networks. It can be viewed as a simple image classification task by multiple classes.
